library(schrute)

theme_set(theme_light())


office_transcripts <- as_tibble(theoffice) %>%
  mutate(season = as.integer(season),

  summarize(avg_rating = mean(imdb_rating)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(season, avg_rating)) +

### Transcripts

```{r}
library(tidytext)

blocklist <- c("yeah", "hey", "uh", "gonna")
blocklist_characters <- c('Everyone', 'All', 'Both', 'Guy', 'Girl', 'Group')

transcript_words <- office_transcripts %>%
  group_by(character) %>%
  filter(n() >= 100,
         n_distinct(episode_name) > 2) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-text_w_direction) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = 'word') %>%
  filter(!word %in% blocklist,
         !character %in% blocklist_characters)
```

### Are there words specific to characters?

```{r}
## Filter to socre set of characters, a lot of characters in specific episodes with specific words

character_tf_idf <- transcript_words %>%
  add_count(word) %>%
  filter(n >= 20) %>%
  count(word, character) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, character, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))
```

### Look for main words for a few main characters

```{r}
 character_tf_idf %>% 
  filter(character == c("Dwight", "Jim", "David Wallace", "Darryl", "Jan", "Holly")) %>%
  group_by(character) %>%
  top_n(10, tf_idf) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder_within(word, tf_idf, character)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_x_reordered() +
  facet_wrap(~ character, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "TF-IDF of character-word pairs")

```
